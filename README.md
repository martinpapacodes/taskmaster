## Lab 26: Beginning TaskMaster

### Problem Domain

#### Feature Tasks

Today, you’ll start building an Android app that will be a main focus of the second half of the course: TaskMaster. While you’ll start small today, over time this will grow to be a fully-featured application.

* Homepage

    * The main page should be built out to match the wireframe. In particular, it should have a heading at the top of the page, an image to mock the “my tasks” view, and buttons at the bottom of the page to allow going to the “add tasks” and “all tasks” page.

* Add a Task

    * On the “Add a Task” page, allow users to type in details about a new task, specifically a title and a body. When users click the “submit” button, show a “submitted!” label on the page.
    
* All Tasks

    * The all tasks page should just be an image with a back button; it needs no functionality. 
      
##### Daily Change Log

* Added homepage, task page, and all tasks page
* When user clicked on clicks on add task button, the app prompts, "Submitted."

## Lab 27: Adding Data to TaskMaster

### Problem Domain

Today, you’ll add the ability to send data among different activities in your application using SharedPreferences and Intents.

#### Feature Tasks

* Task Detail Page

    * Create a Task Detail page. It should have a title at the top of the page, and a Lorem Ipsum description.
    
* Settings Page

    * Create a Settings page. It should allow users to enter their username and hit save.
    
*  Homepage

    * The main page should be modified to contain three different buttons with hardcoded task titles. When a user taps one of the titles, it should go to the Task Detail page, and the title at the top of the page should match the task title that was tapped on the previous page.
      
      The homepage should also contain a button to visit the Settings page, and once the user has entered their username, it should display “{username}’s tasks” above the three task buttons.

##### Daily Change Log

* Added settings page. User now is able to type in their username on the setting page and display the username back to the homepage on top of the task buttons.
* Replaced the image with hardcoded task buttons. When one of the buttons is clicked, the app will take you to the task detail's page.

## Lab 28: RecyclerViews for Displaying Lists of Data

### Problem Domain

Today, you’ll refactor your homepage to look snazzy, with a RecyclerView full of Task data.

#### Feature Tasks

* Task Model

   * Create a Task class. A Task should have a title, a body, and a state. The state should be one of “new”, “assigned”, “in progress”, or “complete”.
    
* Homepage

    * Refactor your homepage to use a RecyclerView for displaying Task data. This should have hardcoded Task data for now.
    
    * Some steps you will likely want to take to accomplish this:
      
        * Create a ViewAdapter class that displays data from a list of Tasks.
        
        * In your MainActivity, create at least three hardcoded Task instances and use those to populate your RecyclerView/ViewAdapter.
        
    
* Ensure that you can tap on any one of the Tasks in the RecyclerView, and it will appropriately launch the detail page with the correct Task title displayed.


##### Daily Change Log

* Added fragment to display hardcoded task in the homepage
* When click on the a task on the RecyclerView, it takes you to task details page where the clicked item is reflected.

## Lab: 34 - Amplify and DynamoDB 

### Feature Tasks

* Tasks Are Cloudy

    * Using the amplify add api command, create a Task resource that replicates our existing Task schema. Update all references to the Task data to instead use AWS Amplify to access your data in DynamoDB instead of in Room.

* Add Task Form

    * Modify your Add Task form to save the data entered in as a Task to DynamoDB.

* Homepage

    * Refactor your homepage’s RecyclerView to display all Task entities in DynamoDB.

#### Problem Domain

Today, your app will gain a scalable backend by using AWS Amplify. We’ll continue to work with Amplify to add more cloud functionality for the rest of the course.
