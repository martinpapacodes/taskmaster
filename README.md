## Lab 26: Beginning TaskMaster

### Feature Tasks

#### Problem Domain

Today, you’ll start building an Android app that will be a main focus of the second half of the course: TaskMaster. While you’ll start small today, over time this will grow to be a fully-featured application.

* Homepage

    * The main page should be built out to match the wireframe. In particular, it should have a heading at the top of the page, an image to mock the “my tasks” view, and buttons at the bottom of the page to allow going to the “add tasks” and “all tasks” page.

* Add a Task

    * On the “Add a Task” page, allow users to type in details about a new task, specifically a title and a body. When users click the “submit” button, show a “submitted!” label on the page.
    
* All Tasks

    * The all tasks page should just be an image with a back button; it needs no functionality.
